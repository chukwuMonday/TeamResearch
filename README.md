Research Question: "Is there a correlation between birth rate and net population growth in Russian regions?"

Key Components of the Research Question
Variables of Interest:

Birth Rate: The number of live births per 1,000 individuals in a population.
Net Population Growth (NPG): The change in population size after accounting for births, deaths, and migration.
Scope:

Geographical Context: Russian regions.
Temporal Context: Data over multiple years (if applicable).
Relationship to Explore:

Whether there is a statistical correlation between birth rate and NPG.
Significance of the Research
Understanding Demographic Trends:
This research provides insights into how birth rates impact overall population growth in Russia. Given Russia's ongoing challenges with population decline, such as aging populations and low birth rates, this research is highly relevant.

Economic and Social Planning:
Knowing the drivers of population growth helps policymakers allocate resources effectively for housing, education, healthcare, and employment.

Academic Contribution:
It adds to the body of demographic research by providing specific regional insights into the Russian population dynamics, which may vary significantly across regions.

Policy Implications
Pro-natalist Policies:
If birth rate strongly correlates with population growth, policies could focus on incentivizing childbirth, such as maternity benefits, childcare support, or tax incentives.

Regional Development Programs:
Identifying regions with low birth rates and slow population growth could help target interventions like healthcare improvement or economic opportunities.

Long-Term Strategic Planning:
Findings could guide government strategies for sustainable development, immigration policy, and urban planning in response to demographic challenges.

Approach to Addressing the Question
Data Analysis:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the trends and distributions of variables.
Check for missing data and outliers in the birth_rate and npg variables.
Statistical Methods:

Use Pearson’s correlation coefficient to assess the linear relationship between birth rate and net population growth.
If the relationship is nonlinear, consider other measures like Spearman’s rank correlation or regression analysis.
Control for Confounders:

Include other factors such as death rate, urbanization, and economic indicators (like gdw) to refine the analysis and ensure birth rate is an independent driver.
Visualization:

Plot scatterplots of birth rate versus NPG by region.
Create regional heatmaps to visualize demographic trends.
Hypothesis Testing:

Conduct hypothesis tests to confirm the presence or absence of a statistically significant correlation.
